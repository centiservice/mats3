/**
 * Very similar to {@link Test_ConcurrencyPerStage}, but with two stages for the service, where the first has 8
 * processors (sleeping 250ms), and the next has 4 (sleeping 125ms) - the total time for 8 messages through the service
 * should then be a tad over 500 ms, not (a little over) 2000 ms as if there was only 1 processor for each stage (the
 * pipelining with two stages reduces it from 4 seconds to 2). Implicitly tests "lambdaconfig" per stage (as well as for
 * endpoint).
 * <p>
 * ASCII-artsy, it looks like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * [Initiator] x 1, firing off NUM_MESSAGES requests.
 *     [Service S0 (init)] x CONCURRENCY StageProcessors (sleeping PROCESSING_TIME / 2 ms) - next
 *     [Service S1 (last)] x CONCURRENCY / 2 StageProcessors (sleeping PROCESSING_TIME / 4 ms) - reply
 * [Terminator] x 1 StageProcessor, getting all the NUM_MESSAGES replies, counting down a latch.
 * </pre>
