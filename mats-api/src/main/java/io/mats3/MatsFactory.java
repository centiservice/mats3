/**
 * The start point for all interaction with Mats - you need to get hold of an instance of this interface to be able to
 * code and configure Mats endpoints, and to perform {@link #getDefaultInitiator() initiations} like sending a message,
 * perform a request and publish a message. Getting hold of a MatsFactory is an implementation specific feature: The
 * <code>JmsMatsFactory</code> is the standard, providing static factory methods, and can be backed by an ActiveMQ- or
 * Artemis-specific JMS ConnectionFactory.
 * <p>
 * <i>An alternative to Java-based programmatic creation of Mats Endpoints is using Mats SpringConfig integration where
 * you use annotations like <code>@EnableMats</code>, <code>@MatsMapping</code> and <code>@MatsClassMapping</code>.
 * Employing Mats SpringConfig, you'll need to get an instance of MatsFactory into the Spring context. The module is
 * called "mats-spring".</i>
 * <p>
 * It is worth realizing that all of the methods {@link #staged(String, Class, Class) staged(..., config)},
 * {@link #single(String, Class, Class, ProcessSingleLambda) single(...)} +
 * {@link #single(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessSingleLambda) w/configs};
 * {@link #terminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda) terminator(...)} +
 * {@link #terminator(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessTerminatorLambda) w/configs} are just convenience
 * methods to the main {@link #staged(String, Class, Class) staged(...)}. These specializations could just as well have
 * resided in a utility class. They are included in the API since these relatively few methods seem to cover most
 * scenarios.
 * <p>
 * <i>(Exception to this are the {@link #subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda)
 * subscriptionTerminator(...)} +
 * {@link #subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, Consumer, Consumer, ProcessTerminatorLambda) w/configs}, as they
 * have different semantics, read the JavaDoc).</i>
 * <p>
 * Regarding order of the Reply Message, State and Incoming Message, which can be a bit annoying to remember when
 * creating endpoints, and when writing {@link ProcessLambda process lambdas}: They are always ordered like this: <b>R,
 * S, I</b>, i.e. <i>Reply, State, Incoming</i>. This is to resemble a method signature having the implicit {@code this}
 * (or {@code self}) reference as the first argument: {@code ReturnType methodName(this, arguments)}. Thus, if you
 * remember that Mats is created to enable you to write messaging oriented endpoints that <i>look like</i> they are
 * methods, then it might stick! The process lambda thus has args (context, state, incomingMsg), unless it lacks state.
 * Even if it lacks state, the context is always first, and the incoming message is always last.
 * <ul>
 * <li>For a MultiStage endpoint, you will have all of reply message type, state type, and incoming message type. The
 * params of the {@link #staged(String, Class, Class) staged(..)}-method of MatsFactory is [EndpointId, <b>Reply</b>
 * Class, <b>State</b> Class] - and each of the added {@link MatsEndpoint#stage(Class, ProcessLambda) stages} specifies
 * their own <b>Incoming</b> class and stage process lambda. The {@link ProcessLambda stage lambda} params will then be:
 * [Context, <b>State</b>, <b>Incoming</b>]. If you employ the {@link MatsEndpoint#lastStage(Class, ProcessReturnLambda)
 * lastStage(..)}, its {@link ProcessReturnLambda process return lambda} will have the reply type as its return
 * type.</li>
 * <li>For a SingleStage endpoint, you will have incoming message, and reply message - there is no state, since that is
 * an object that traverses between the stages in a multi-stage endpoint, and this endpoint is just a single stage. The
 * params of the {@link #single(String, Class, Class, ProcessSingleLambda) single(..)}-method of MatsFactory is thus
 * [EndpointId, <b>Reply</b> Class, <b>Incoming</b> Class, process lambda] - you specify the process lambda directly.
 * The {@link ProcessSingleLambda process single lambda} params are: [Context, <b>Incoming</b>] - the reply type is the
 * the return type of the lambda.</li>
 * <li>In a Terminator, you have an incoming message, and state (which the initiator set), but no Reply, as a terminator
 * doesn't reply. The params of the {@link #terminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda)
 * terminator(..)}-method of MatsFactory is thus [EndpointId, <b>State</b> Class, <b>Incoming</b> Class, process lambda]
 * - also here specifying the process lambda directly. The lambda params of the {@link ProcessTerminatorLambda process
 * terminator lambda} are: [Context, <b>State</b>, <b>Incoming</b>]</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All these type arguments and lambdas and whatnot in the JavaDoc can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but when
 * actually coding Mats Endpoints, it clicks into place and hopefully gives a smooth experience.
 * <p>
 * Note: If upon creation of an Endpoint provide an <code>endpointId</code> argument which starts with a ".", the
 * endpointId will be prefixed with the {@link FactoryConfig#getCommonEndpointGroupId() CommonEndpointGroupId}. This may
 * be a good way to ensure consistency in endpoint naming.
 * <p>
 * Note: It should be possible to use instances of <code>MatsFactory</code> as keys in a <code>HashMap</code>, i.e.
 * their equals and hashCode should remain stable throughout the life of the MatsFactory. Depending on the
 * implementation, instance equality may be sufficient. Note that the {@link MatsFactoryWrapper} is implemented to
 * forward equals and hashCode to wrappee.
