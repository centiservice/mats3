     * then</b> some situation occurs that makes it impossible to send out messages. <i>(Some developers might recognize
     * this as the <i>"VERY BAD!-initiation"</i> situation)</i>.
     * <p>
     * This is a rare, but unfortunate situation, but which is hard to guard completely against, in particular in the
     * "Best Effort 1-Phase Commit" paradigm that the current Mats implementations runs on. What it means, is that if
     * you e.g. in the initiate-lambda did some "job allocation" logic on a table in a database, and based on that
     * allocation sent out e.g. 5 messages, the job <i>allocation</i> will now have happened, but the <i>messages have
     * not actually been sent</i>. The result is that in the database, you will see those jobs as processed
     * (semantically "started processing"), but in reality the downstream endpoints never started working on them since
     * the message was not actually sent out.
     * <p>
     * This situation can to a degree be alleviated if you catch this exception, and then use a <i>compensating
     * transaction</i> to de-allocate the jobs in the database again. However, since bad things often happen in
     * clusters, you might not be able to do the de-allocation either (due to the database becoming inaccessible at the
     * same instant - e.g. the reason that the messages could not be set was that the network cable became unplugged, or
     * that this node actually lost power at that instant). A way to at least catch when this happens, is to employ a
     * state machine to the job allocation logic: First pick jobs for this node by setting the state column of
     * job-entries whose state is "UNPROCESSED" to some status like "ALLOCATED" (along with a column of which node
     * allocated them (i.e. "hostname" of this node) and a column for timestamp of when they were allocated). In the
     * initiator, you pick the jobs that was allocated to this node, set the status to "SENT" and send the outgoing
     * messages. Finally, in the terminator endpoint (which you specify in the initiation), you set the status to
     * "DONE". Then you make a health check: Assuming that in normal conditions such jobs should always be processed in
     * seconds, you make a health check that scans the table for rows which have been in the "ALLOCATED" or "SENT"
     * status for e.g. 15 minutes: Such rows are very suspicious, and should be checked up by humans. Sitting in
     * "ALLOCATED" status would imply that the node that allocated the job went down (and has not (yet) come back up)
     * before it managed to initiate the messages, while sitting in "SENT" would imply that the message had started, but
     * not gotten through the processing: Either that message flow sits in a downstream Dead Letter Queue due to some
     * error, or you ended up in the situation explained here: The database commit went through, but the messages was
     * not sent.
     * <p>
     * Please note that this should, in a somewhat stable operations environment, happen extremely seldom: What needs to
     * occur for this to happen, is that in the sliver of time between the commit of the database and the commit of the
     * message broker, this node crashes, the network is lost, or the message broker goes down. Given that a check for
     * broker liveliness is performed right before the database commit, that time span is very tight. But to make the
     * most robust systems that can monitor themselves, you should consider employing a state machine handling as
     * outlined above. You might never see that health check trip, but now you can at least sleep without thinking about
     * that 1 billion dollar order that was never processed.
     * <p>
     * PS: Best effort 1PC: Two transactions are opened: one for the message broker, and one for the database. The
     * business logic and possibly database reads and changes are performed. The database is committed first, as that
     * has many more failure scenarios than the message systems, e.g. data or code problems giving integrity constraint
     * violations, and spurious stuff like MS SQL's deadlock victim, etc. Then the message queue is committed, as the
     * only reason for the message broker to not handle a commit is basically that you've had infrastructure problems
     * like connectivity issues or that the broker has crashed.
     * <p>
     * Notice that it has been decided to not let this exception extend the {@link MatsBackendException}, even though it
     * is definitely a backend problem. The reason is that it in all situations where {@code MatsBackendException} is
     * raised, the other resources have not been committed yet, as opposed to situations where this
     * {@code MatsMessageSendException} is raised. Luckily, in this time and age, we have multi-exception catch blocks
     * if you want to handle both the same.

         * <p>
         * It should be a world-unique Id, preferably set all the way back when some actual person performed some event.
         * E.g. in a "new order" situation, the Id would best be set when the user clicked the "place order" button on
         * the web page - or maybe even derived from the event when he first initiated the shopping cart - or maybe even

         * some outcome, a robust, versatile and information-rich track/trace Id makes wonders.
         * <p>
         * <b>It is strongly recommended to use small, dense, <u>information rich</u> Trace Ids.</b> Sticking in an UUID
         * as Trace Id certainly fulfils the uniqueness-requirement, but it is a crappy solution, as it by itself does
         * not give any hint of source, cause, relevant entities, or goal. <i>(It isn't even dense for the uniqueness an
         * UUID gives, which also is way above the required uniqueness unless you handle billions of such messages per
         * minute. A random alphanum (A-Z,a-z,0-9) string of much smaller length would give plenty enough
         * uniqueness).</i> The following would be a much better Trace Id than a random UUID, which follows some scheme
         * that could be system wide: "Web.placeOrder[cid:43512][cart:xa4ru5285fej]qz7apy9". From this example TraceId
         * we could infer that it originated at the <i>Web system</i>, it regards <i>Placing an order</i> for
         * <i>Customer Id 43512</i>, it regards the <i>Shopping Cart Id xa4ru5285fej</i>, and it contains some
         * uniqueness ('qz7apy9') generated at the initiating, so that even if the customer managed to click three times
         * on the "place order" button for the same cart, you would still be able to separate the resulting three
         * different Mats call flows.
         * <p>
         * You should consider storing the traceId as a column in any inserted rows in any databases that was affected
         * by this call flow, e.g. in the row for a placed order, you'd have the traceId as a column. This both to be
         * able to tie this db row back to the logging system, but also if new Mats flows are initiated based on this
         * row, you can include the order TraceId in the new TraceId (with either "|" or "+" as separator).
         * <p>
         * For situations where one Mats Flow "forks" new Mats flows, make new TraceIds for the "sub flows" by tying
         * together the existing TraceId and a new Sub TraceId with a "|". In the order/shipping example, the user would
         * first have placed an order, resulting in an entry in an order database table - where the traceId was stored
         * along. Then, when some batch process Mats Flow initiated the filling process, you would pick up the order's
         * traceId and append that to the sub Mats Flow. Sub Flow Mats TraceId = "{Filling Batch Id}|{Existing Order
         * TraceId}". If you took this all the way, you could in your logging system follow the "total flow" from the
         * initial click on the web page, through the order book, order processing, shipment, and all the way to the
         * delivered and signed package on the person's door - even if the entirety of the order fulfillment consists of
         * multiple "stop and go" sub-flows (the stops being where the process stays for a while as an entry in a
         * database, here "order", then possibly "filling", "shipping" and finally "delivery", or whatever your multiple
         * processes' flows consists of).
         * <p>
         * The "+" character should be used to indicate that an "initiated from the outside" TraceId is concatenated by
         * multiple parts, which so far has been used to pick up an X-Request-ID header from a HTTP-request, and
         * prepending this to the TraceId for a resulting Mats-flow, i.e. Mats TraceId="{X-Request-ID}+{Flow TraceID}".
         * (Check out {@link FactoryConfig#setInitiateTraceIdModifier(Function)} for a way to automate this.)
         * <p>
         * The difference between "|" and "+" is meant to be that "|" indicates that there is a Mats Flow TraceId on
         * both sides of the "|", while the "+" is used when a "from the outside"-initiated TraceId is built up by
         * multiple pieces, e.g. X-Request-Id, or Batch Run Number, on the left side. Remember, this is all meant for
         * human consumption, in particular when debugging. Do what you feel is meaningful - the Mats system doesn't
         * care!

         * initiation is set to 5000 ms. The request message stays 4 seconds in queue, before being received and
         * processed, where the processing took 100 ms. The reply-message will thus have its TTL set to 4900 ms: 5000 ms
         * TTL - 100 ms for processing. The reply message stays 4 seconds in queue before being received. The total
         * "time in flight" has now been 8.1 seconds, and there was still 900 ms left of the reply-message's TTL. The
         * rationale for not deducting queue-time on the subsequent message is that there is no easy way to get the
         * "queue time" which does not involve taking the difference between two timestamps, but in a multi-server
         * architecture there is a clear possibility of clock skews between different services, even for instances of
         * the same service. You could then deduce a too high queue time, deducting a too high value from the
         * reply-message's TTL, and effectively time out the full message flow too early. However, for the intended use

         * also not be set for "getters" that are performed to decide upon a state - e.g. for validation of new orders:
         * The getter that checks credit should be audited. If such a getter is a part of a Mats flow, this should not
         * be a problem, as the initiator of the "add order" Mats flow would obviously not set noAudit(). However, if it
         * is coded as multiple "stop and go" flows, i.e. add the order to some incoming order table. Then a next,
         * separate Mats flow is validation: <i>That</i> getter <i>should</i> be audited, hence do not set noAudit().
