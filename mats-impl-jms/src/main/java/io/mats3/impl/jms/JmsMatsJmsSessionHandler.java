/**
 * Interface for implementing JMS Connection and JMS Session handling. This can implement both different connection
 * sharing mechanisms, and should implement some kind of Session pooling for initiators. It can also implement logic for
 * "is this connection up?" mechanisms, to minimize the gap whereby a JMS Connection is in a bad state but the
 * application has not noticed this yet.
 * <p>
 * The reason for session pooling for initiators is that a JMS Session can only be used for one thread, and since
 * initiators are shared throughout the code base, one initiator might be used by several threads at the same time.
 * <p>
 * For reference wrt. cardinality between Sessions and Connections: In the JCA spec, it is specified that one JMS
 * Connection is used per one JMS Session (and in the JMS spec v2.0, this is "formalized" in that in the "simplified JMS
 * API" one have a new class JMSContext, which combines a Connection and Session in one). This will here mean that for
 * each {@link JmsMatsTxContextKey}, there shall be a unique JMS Connection (i.e. each StageProcessor has its own
 * Connection). It does makes some sense, though, that JMS Connections at least are shared for all StageProcessors for a
 * Stage - or even for all StageProcessors for all Stages of an Endpoint. Otherwise, a large system built on Mats will
 * use a pretty massive amount of Connections. However, sharing one Connection for the entire application/service (i.e.
 * for all endpoints in the JVM) might be a bit too heavy burden for a single JMS Connection.
