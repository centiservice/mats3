/**
 * Implementation of {@link JmsMatsTransactionManager} handling only JMS (getting Connections, and creating Sessions),
 * doing all transactional handling "native", i.e. using only the JMS API (as opposed to e.g. using Spring and its
 * transaction managers).
 * <p />
 * The JMS Connection and Session handling is performed in calling code, where the resulting {@link JmsSessionHolder} is
 * provided to the {@link TransactionalContext_Jms#doTransaction(JmsMatsInternalExecutionContext, ProcessingLambda)}.
 * <p />
 * Note: Musing about the JmsMats transactional handling 6 years later (2021-02-03), I do find it a tad bit obscure.
 * This entire Mats implementation is a JMS implementation, and all JMS Session handling is handled by the "core", but
 * just exactly commit and rollback is handled in this class. The extensions handling SQL are much more "independent" as
 * such. However, the big point is the {@link JmsMatsStageProcessor}, which has a JMS Consumer-pump/loop, and that
 * Consumer's JMS Session is intimately intertwined with the transaction aspects handled here. Had it only been the
 * {@link JmsMatsInitiator} and as such initiations of messages that should be handled, much more of the JMS transaction
 * management could have been handled here. (Actually, the only transactional aspect at that point would have been to
 * put a transaction around the actual sending, so that if more than one message was sent, they were all either sent or
 * not.)
