/**
 * Implementation of the {@link io.mats3 Mats<sup>3</sup> API} on Java Message Service v2 (JMS v2) .
 * <p/>
 * Note that the implementation actually works with JMS v1.1, but per 2023 there is no known broker that only implements
 * JMS v1.1. The v2.0 API is a strict superset of the v1.1 API, and the implementation only uses the v1.1 API features.
