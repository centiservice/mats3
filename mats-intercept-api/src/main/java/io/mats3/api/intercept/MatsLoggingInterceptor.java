     * If this key is present on the {@link MatsInitiate#setTraceProperty(String, Object) TraceProperties} of a Mats
     * Flow, with the value {@link Boolean#TRUE}, no ordinary log lines should be emitted while initiating or stage
     * processing the Mats Flow, <i>assuming</i> that the implicated endpoints
     * {@link #SUPPRESS_LOGGING_ENDPOINT_ALLOWS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY allows} logging suppression. This is only to be used for
     * frequent system messages that otherwise would swamp the log, and should never be used for ordinary processing.
     * <p>
     * Note wrt. suppression of initiation logging: An outgoing message starts a Mats Flow. It is the message that holds
     * the TraceProperty saying that logging should be suppressed. Three things: 1. Contrasted to endpoints, initiations
     * do not have an {@link #SUPPRESS_LOGGING_ENDPOINT_ALLOWS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY "allow"} concept, as it makes no sense
     * security wise since the initiator could just change the allowance. 2. If multiple messages are initiated, then
     * they all must agree of suppression for the initiation log lines to be suppressed. 3. If you initiate, but do not
     * send any messages after all (inside the initiation you find that there is nothing to do), then it is impossible
     * to suppress logging. Thus, you should instead perform whatever checking to decide whether to send a message
     * before going into initiation.
     * <p>
     * Note: The <code>MatsMetricsLoggingInterceptor</code> has logic whereby every X minutes, a summary of suppressed
     * logs lines is output (if any), grouped into matsFactory/initApp/initiatorId/stageId, so that it is possible to
     * assert liveliness of the system, and also get an idea of how much messages are actually processed even if
     * suppressed. Note that also the first ever flow (init and stages), and any flow after such a summarization, will
     * be logged fully. The rationale behind this is that the summary doesn't contain any metrics (timings and sizes),
     * so to get at least a hunch of this, a "normal" log line is output.
     * <p>
     * Note: Suppression of logging effectively removes these initiations and processing from any aggregate metrics
     * based on the log system, e.g. doing "number of messages per second" in Kibana will lose out on these messages
     * since they aren't logged (except for the summary every X minutes mentioned above, but those won't be caught by
     * your standard Kibana queries). Metrics in form of <code>MatsMicrometerInterceptor</code> are not affected -
     * unless those also are {@link MatsMetricsInterceptor#SUPPRESS_METRICS_TRACE_PROPERTY_KEY suppressed!}
