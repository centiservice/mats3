     * metrics (typically overviews, i.e. "what microservice have most messages"), and should never be used for ordinary

     * <p>
     * Note wrt. suppression of initiation metrics: An outgoing message starts a Mats Flow. It is the message that holds
     * the TraceProperty saying that metrics should be suppressed. Three things: 1. Contrasted to endpoints, initiations
     * do not have an {@link #SUPPRESS_METRICS_ENDPOINT_ALLOWS_ATTRIBUTE_KEY "allow"} concept, as it makes no sense
     * security wise since the initiator could just change the allowance. 2. If multiple messages are initiated, then
     * they all must agree of suppression for the initiation metrics to be suppressed. 3. If you initiate, but do not
     * send any messages after all (inside the initiation you find that there is nothing to do), then it is impossible
     * to suppress metrics. Thus, you should instead perform whatever checking to decide whether to send a message
     * before going into initiation.
     * <p>
     * Note: Suppression of logging effectively removes these initiations and processing from any aggregate metrics,
     * e.g. doing "number of message per second" in Prometheus will lose out on these messages since they aren't metrics
     * recorded. Metrics in form of <code>MatsLoggingInterceptor</code> are not affected - unless those also are
