/**
 * Will produce an "embeddable" HTML interface - notice that there are CSS ({@link #getStyleSheet(Appendable)}),
 * JavaScript ({@link #getJavaScript(Appendable)}) and HTML
 * ({@link #createFactoryReport(Appendable, boolean, boolean, boolean) createFactoryReport(Appendable,..)}) to include.
 * If the {@link LocalStatsMatsInterceptor} is installed on the {@link MatsFactory} which handles the Intercept API, it
 * will include pretty nice "local statistics" for all initiators, endpoints and stages.
 * <p />
 * Note: You are expected to {@link #create(MatsFactory) create} one instance of an implementation of this interface per
 * MatsFactory, and keep these around for the lifetime of the MatsFactories (i.e. for the JVM) - as in multiple
 * singletons. Do not create one per HTML request. The reason for this is that at a later point, this class might be
 * extended with "active" features, like stopping and starting endpoints, change the concurrency etc - at which point it
 * might itself need active state, e.g. for a feature like "stop this endpoint for 30 minutes".
