/**
 * Defines the operations needed serialize and deserialize {@link MatsTrace}s to and from byte arrays (e.g. UTF-8
 * encoded JSON or XML, or some binary serialization protocol), <b>and</b> STOs and DTOs to and from some type, e.g.
 * byte arrays or Strings. This is separated out from the Mats communication implementation (i.e. JMS or RabbitMQ), as
 * it is a separate aspect, i.e. both the JMS and RabbitMQ implementation can utilize the same serializer.
 * <p />
 * There are two levels of serialization needed: For the DTOs and STOs that the Mats API expose to the "end user", and
 * then the serialization of the MatsTrace itself. There is an implementation of MatsTrace in the impl package called
 * <code>MatsTraceFieldImpl</code> which is meant to be serialized by fields (thus the field names are short).
 * <p>
 * The default implementation in 'mats-serial-json' (<code>MatsSerializerJson</code>) employs the Jackson JSON library
 * to serialize to JSON, both for the "inner" DTO-and-STO part, and for the "outer" MatsTrace part.
 * <p>
 * It is worth pointing out that <i>all</i> the communicating parties needs to be using the same serialization
 * mechanism, as this constitute the "wire-representation" of the protocol that {@link MatsTrace} represents. There is
 * however a mechanism to handle different serializations, by means of a {@link #handlesMeta(String) metadata
 * construct}: Along with the serialized bytes, a metadata String must be provided. It is thus possible to construct a
 * MatsSerializer that holds multiple underlying MatsSerializers, choosing based on the "meta" String. This can then be
 * used to upgrade from a format to another, see later chapter.
 * <p>
 * Serialization and deserialization of the MatsTrace is quite obviously a performance critical part of the Mats
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * <b>Two serialization mechanisms:</b> The MatsSerializer actually defines two separate serialization mechanisms: One
 * for the DTOs and STOs, and one for the MatsTrace which contains the serialized versions of the DTOs and STOs. These
 * two mechanisms are in principle separate, and one could imagine that one would want to use different serialization
 * mechanisms for these two - but the MatsTrace/MatsSerializer mechanism have the implementation of both in the same
 * construct - and the combination is identified by the "meta" described in the next paragraph. The default
 * implementation uses the same serialization mechanism for both (Jackson).
 * <p>
 * <b>Meta:</b> There's a concept of "meta", and the method {@link #handlesMeta(String)}. The "meta" is a String that is
 * provided along with the serialized bytes, and which is needed back when deserializing. It has two functions: Identify
 * the MatsSerializer, and provide meta information to that serializer - currently whether compression was employed, and
 * the size of the uncompressed data. One can make a "super-MatsSerializer" that wraps multiple MatsSerializers, and
 * which chooses the correct for deserialization one based on providing the meta to each of the contained
 * MatsSerializers <code>handlesMeta(..)</code> and see which returns true. For serialization, this super-MatsSerializer
 * will be coded or configured to use one specific of the contained MatsSerializers. This can be used to upgrade the
 * serialization format in a two-step fashion: First make a revision-change that includes the new serializer version,
 * but still employs the old for serialization. Then, when all parties are upgraded to the new config, you make a new
 * revision or minor change that changes the config to employ the new serializer for serialization. Then, when all
 * parties are up on this version, you can optionally make a third version that removes the old serializer. The "meta"
 * is also needed to deserialize the DTOs and STOs - it can then be gotten from
 * {@link MatsTrace#getMatsSerializerMeta()}, since the MatsSerializer sets this transient field upon construction of a
 * new MatsTrace, and when deserializing a MatsTrace.
