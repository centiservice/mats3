/**
 * Defines the operations needed serialize and deserialize {@link MatsTrace}s to and from byte arrays (e.g. UTF-8
 * encoded JSON or XML, or some binary serialization protocol), and STOs and DTOs to and from some type, e.g. byte
 * arrays or Strings. This is separated out from the Mats communication implementation (i.e. JMS or RabbitMQ), as it is
 * a separate aspect, i.e. both the JMS and RabbitMQ implementation can utilize the same serializer.
 * <p />
 * There are two levels of serialization needed: For the DTOs and STOs that the Mats API expose to the "end user", and
 * then the serialization of the MatsTrace itself. There is an implementation of MatsTrace in the impl package called
 * <code>MatsTraceFieldImpl</code> which is meant to be serialized by fields (thus the field names are short).
 * <p>
 * The default implementation in 'mats-serial-json' (<code>MatsSerializerJson</code>) employs the Jackson JSON library
 * to serialize to JSON, both for the "inner" DTO-and-STO part, and for the "outer" MatsTrace part.
 * <p>
 * It is worth pointing out that <i>all</i> the communicating parties needs to be using the same serialization
 * mechanism, as this constitute the "wire-representation" of the protocol that {@link MatsTrace} represents. There is
 * however a mechanism to handle different serializations, by means of a {@link #handlesMeta(String) metadata
 * construct}: Along with the serialized bytes, a metadata String must be provided. It is thus possible to construct a
 * MatsSerializer that holds multiple underlying MatsSerializers, choosing based on the "meta" String. This can then be
 * used to upgrade from a format to another.
