/**
 * Together with the {@link MatsSerializer}, this interface describes one way to implement a wire-protocol for how Mats
 * communicates. It is up to the implementation of the <code>MatsFactory</code> to implement a protocol of how the Mats
 * API is transferred over the wire. This is one such implementation that can be used, which is employed by the default
 * JMS implementation of Mats.
 * <p>
 * The MatsTrace is designed to contain all previous {@link Call}s in a processing, thus helping the debugging for any
 * particular stage immensely: All earlier calls with data and stack frames for this processing is kept in the trace,
 * thus enabling immediate understanding of what lead up to the particular situation.
 * <p>
 * However, for any particular invocation (invoke, request or reply), only the current (last) {@link Call} - along with
 * the stack frames for the same and lower stack depths than the current call - is needed to execute the stage. This
 * makes it possible to use a condensed variant of MatsTrace that only includes the single current {@link Call}, along
 * with the relevant stack frames. This is defined by the {@link KeepMatsTrace} enum.
 * <p>
 * One envisions that for development and the production stabilization phase of the system, the long form is used, while
 * when the system have performed flawless for a while, one can change it to use the condensed form, thereby shaving
 * some cycles for the serialization and deserialization, but more importantly potentially quite a bit of bandwidth and
 * message processing compared to transfer of the full trace.
