/**
 * Provides a factory for a Spring-integrated Wrapper/Facade around a JMS ConnectionFactory, which in addition to
 * supporting the production setup, also facilitates the development situation where you often want to run against
 * either an in-vm MQ Broker or against a MQ Broker running on localhost, and also integrates with the
 * "mats-spring-test" integration test library where when run with the <code>MatsTestProfile</code> you will most
 * probably want an in-vm setup (typically mocking up the project-external Mats endpoints that the tested endpoints
 * collaborate with). In the in-vm broker situations, the JMS ConnectionFactory instantiation lambda you provide for
 * what will be used in the production setup will <b>not</b> be invoked, but instead an in-vm ActiveMQ Broker will be
 * started, and an ActiveMQ ConnectionFactory will be produced. <i>(ActiveMQ is default, but this class by default
 * employs the {@link MatsTestBroker} tool class for creating these connections, and this class can be directed to
 * instead create, or connect to, an Artemis broker).</i>
 * <p/>
 * Note: The actual decision logic and "Spring interfacing" is done in {@link ScenarioConnectionFactoryWrapper}, which
 * is the actual class of instances that will end up as Spring beans - this class is a producer of such instances,
 * simplifying the configuration, providing sane defaults.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Do note that this is purely a convenience functionality, and is in no way required for the Mats system to
 * work!</b>
 * <p/>
 * As a matter of fact, you can achieve the exact same with Spring's Profiles (or any other "switch configuration based
 * on some property or state"-logic you can cook up), but this class effectively represents an opinionated
 * implementation of the config switching that will be needed in most scenarios working with Mats, and will probably
 * yield less configuration overall. Moreover, Mats will most probably be employed in a micro/multiple service
 * architecture, and in such situations, it is nice to make some in-house library that constitute basic building blocks
 * that all the services will need. With that in mind, this class also facilitates so you can easily construct an
 * <code>@CompanyMatsSetup</code>-type annotation which alone will pull up both the needed ConnectionFactory (with URL
 * and whatever needed already set) and MatsFactory, which handles all the mentioned scenarios, by merely placing that
 * annotation on the main config class of your service.
 * <p/>
 * The point is this: If you are new to Message Queue based development, you will probably soon sit with the problem of
 * how to create a code base that efficiently lets you run it in production, while also is easy to develop on, and being
 * simple to perform integration test on your endpoints - the problem being that you need different types of
 * ConnectionFactories for the different scenarios, and in some cases also needing an in-vm MQ Broker.
 * <p/>
 * There are typically four different scenarios that you need to juggle between, the two latter being identical wrt. the
 * Mats setup (which is the reason that {@link MatsScenario} only has three scenarios defined):
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Production / External Broker</b> (any production-like environments, e.g. Staging/Pre-prod): This is the
 * standard/regular situation for a MQ-based application or service: Connect to the common external production or
 * staging MQ Broker that all other services and their Mats endpoints connect to. <i>(Note that for the scenarios taken
 * into account by this mechanism, all "external environments" (i.e. "production-like") are considered the same.
 * However, you will most probably want the URLs to the external MQ Broker to be different between production and
 * staging and any other such environment. Such switching must be handled by another mechanism.)</i></li>
 *
 * <li><b>Localhost development</b>, where you are developing on one project employing Mats Endpoints, but also run this
 * project's required collaborating projects/services with their Mats Endpoints on your local development box (typically
 * running the project you currently develop on directly in the IDE, while the other can either run in IDE or on command
 * line): Connect to a MQ Broker that you've fired up on your local development box, i.e. localhost, which the other
 * services running locally also connects to.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>Local-VM development</b>, where you just want to run the service alone, probably with some of the other
 * collaborating Mats Endpoints from other projects/services mocked up in the same project: Connect to an in-vm MQ
 * Broker. <b>An important thing to ensure here is that these mocks, which by definition resides on the same classpath,
 * must <i>NOT</i> end up running in the production environment!</b> - preferably such mocks should not even be included
 * in the production artifact.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>Local-VM integration testing</b>, where you have integration tests either utilizing the full app config with
 * overwriting of certain beans/endpoints using "Remock" or @MockBean, and mocking out collaborating Mats Endpoints from
 * other projects/services; or piece together the required beans/endpoints using e.g. @Import and mocking out other
 * endpoints: Connect to an in-vm MQ Broker.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Please now read (all the) JavaDoc of {@link MatsProfiles} and its enum values!
 * <p/>
 * For the localhost and localVM scenarios, this class by default utilizes the ActiveMQ Broker and ConnectionFactory.
 * For all scenarios, but in particular for the "regular" (production-like), you can provide whatever ConnectionFactory
 * you want (configured as you desire) - this class will just wrap it.
