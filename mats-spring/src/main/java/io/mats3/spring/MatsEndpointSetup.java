/**
 * <b>NOTE: You should probably use {@link MatsClassMapping} or {@link MatsMapping @MatsMapping} instead - or otherwise
 * consider plain programmatic registration instead of using this feature as it brings very little convenience compared
 * to pure Java.</b>
 * <p/>
 * A method annotated with this repeatable annotation specifies a method that shall <em>set up</em> a Multi-Staged Mats
 * Endpoint. Note that as opposed to {@link MatsMapping @MatsMapping} and {@link MatsClassMapping}, this method will be
 * invoked <em>once</em> at startup to <i>set up</i> the endpoint, and will not be invoked each time when the Mats
 * endpoint gets a message (as is the case with {@literal @MatsMapping} and {@literal @MatsClassMapping}).
 * <p/>
 * You specify the EndpointId, state STO type and the reply DTO type using annotation parameters. The method is then
 * invoked once during Spring context startup, with a {@link MatsEndpoint MatsEndpoint} instance as argument, as would
 * have been returned by {@link MatsFactory#staged(String, Class, Class) matsFactory.staged(...)} when using
 * programmatic registration. The method should then invoke {@link MatsEndpoint#stage(Class, ProcessLambda)
 * endpoint.stage(..)} and {@link MatsEndpoint#lastStage(Class, ProcessReturnLambda) endpoint.lastStage(..)} to set up
 * the MatsEndpoint - as you would have done when using programmatic registration. You can also have an argument of type
 * {@link EndpointConfig EndpointConfig} to be able to configure the endpoint - but you can also do this using the
 * config getters on the endpoint instance, and for each stage you create (e.g. to set concurrency). Remember again that
 * this is a <i>setup method</i> where you should set up the endpoint, and it is invoked only <i>once</i> during
 * startup, and then never again.
 * <p/>
 * In a multi-MatsFactory setup, you may qualify which MatsFactory this Endpoint should be constructed on - read JavaDoc
 * on @{@link MatsMapping} for how this works.
