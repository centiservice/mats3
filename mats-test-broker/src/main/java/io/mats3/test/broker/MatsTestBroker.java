         * Note that I've encountered two different problems:
         * <ol>
         * <li>It seemingly just doesn't work! Evidently, what should happen is that all DLQs goes to the
         * "DeadLetterAddress" <i>Address</i> specified, but then there should be created original-queue specific DLQ
         * <i>Queues</i> that consume from these using a <i>Filter</i> that only consume the correct DLQs from the
         * Address. However, I cannot see these queues.</li>
         * <li>The DLQ address and queues are seemingly not "persistent" - they are auto-generated, and as such are
         * auto-deleted when not needed. This however seems to imply that if there are no consumer to the queue when a
         * dead letter is created, it will just not be delivered to that queue at all?! Thus, sometimes when the
         * MatsTestBrokerInterface starts looking for the DLQ, it is not there (and this logic would, if correct,
         * obviously make it useless in a production setup, as the entire idea there is that the actual dead letters
         * should stick around to someone gets to look at them). Note that this is not a problem with the current setup,
         * and the reason for that is, AFAIU, that the actual DLQ address and queue are specified <i>explicitly</i> in
         * the AddressConfiguration. I assume that this could be fixed by using an AddressSetting that specified
         * autoDeleteAddresses=false and autoDeleteQueues=false, as I've tried to do in the code below. However, since I
         * can't the original intent of getting a specific DLQ per queue to work, I do not know if that would work
         * either.</li>
         * </ol>
