/**
 * Helper class to test Mats3 Endpoints which are defined using the Mats3 SpringConfig annotations, but without using
 * the full Spring harness for testing. That is, you write tests in a "pure Java" style, but can still test your
 * Spring-defined Mats endpoints. This can be terser and faster than using the full Spring test harness.
 * <p>
 * By having at least one such test, you ensure an "integration test" of the Mats endpoint by taking it up, checking the
 * annotations, and that state and DTOs can be instantiated and serialized.
 * <p>
 * The solution still creates a Spring context internally to initialize the Mats endpoints, but this should be viewed as
 * an implementation detail, and the Spring context is not made available for the test - the endpoints are just present
 * in the MatsFactory. The Spring context is created for each test, and is not shared between tests. The Endpoints will
 * be registered (anew) on the provided {@link MatsFactory} for each test method, and deleted after the test method has
 * run.
 * <p>
 * Classes with SpringConfig Mats3 Endpoints can either be registered using the
 * {@link #withAnnotatedMatsClasses(Class...)} method, or by using the {@link #withAnnotatedMatsInstances(Object...)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * The classes-variant is intended to be used on creation of the Extension, i.e. at the field initialization point.
 * Technically, it will register the class in a Spring context, and put all the fields of the test class as beans
 * available for injection on that class - that is, dependencies in the Mats3 annotated classes will be resolved using
 * the fields of the test class. It is important that fields are initialized before this extension runs, if there are
 * dependencies in the test class needed by the Mats annotated class. When using Mockito and the {@code @Mock}
 * annotation, this is resolved automatically, since Mockito will initialize the fields before the Extension is created.
 * <p>
 * The instances-variant registers the Mats annotated class when called. You will then have to initialize the class
 * yourself, before registering it, probably using the constructor used when Spring otherwise would constructor-inject
 * the instance. This is relevant if you only have a few tests that need the endpoint, and possibly other tests that are
 * unit testing by calling directly on an instance of the class (i.e. calling directly on the {@code @MatsMapping} or
 * {@code @Stage} methods).
 * <p>
 * There are examples of both in the test classes, check out the Extension-based test class
 * {@code 'io.mats3.test.jupiter.J_ExtensionMatsAnnotatedClassTest' } for the broadest set of examples.
