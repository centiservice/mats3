/**
 * Helper class to test classes annotated with Mats annotations.
 * <p>
 * This class can be used to test classes annotated with Mats annotations, without having to create a full Spring
 * context in the test, and include Spring for testing. It still creates a Spring context internally to initialize the
 * Mats endpoints, but this is not exposed to the test.
 * <p>
 * Classes can either be registered using the #withClasses method, or by using the #addAnnotatedMatsBeans method.
 * #withClasses is intended to be used on creation of the Extension, and will register the class in a Spring context.
 * Dependencies will be read from the fields of the test class. It is important that fields are initialized before
 * this extension runs, if there are dependencies in the test class needed by the Mats annotated class. Usually this
 * will be resolved by using Mockito, and the @Mock annotation. Those fields will be initialized before this extension
 * runs, and will be available for the Spring context.
 * <p>
 * Please note that this will register the endpoints for each and every test.
 * <p>
 * The other option is to use the #addAnnotatedMatsBeans method, which will register the Mats annotated class when
 * called. This can be used when you want to initialize the annotated class by yourself, and only have a few tests
 * that need the endpoint, and other tests are unit tests calling directly on an instance of the class instead.
 * This will still allow for an integration test of the Mats endpoint, checking annotations, and that state and
 * dtos can be serialized if needed.
