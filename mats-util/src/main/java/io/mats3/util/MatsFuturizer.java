/**
 * An instance of this class acts as a bridge service between the synchronous world of e.g. a HTTP request, and the
 * asynchronous world of Mats. In a given project, you typically create a singleton instance of this class upon startup,
 * and employ it for all such scenarios. In short, in a HTTP service handler, you initialize a Mats flow using
 * {@link #futurizeNonessential(CharSequence, String, String, Class, Object)
 * singletonFuturizer.futurizeNonessential(...)} (or
 * {@link #futurize(CharSequence, String, String, int, TimeUnit, Class, Object, InitiateLambda) futurize(...)} for full
 * configurability), specifying which Mats Endpoint to invoke and the request DTO instance, and then you get a
 * {@link CompletableFuture} in return. This future will complete once the invoked Mats Endpoint replies.
 * <p/>
 * It is extremely important to understand that this is NOT how you compose multiple Mats Endpoints together! This is
 * ONLY supposed to be used when you are in a synchronous context (e.g. in a Servlet, or a Spring @RequestMapping) "on
 * the edge" of the Mats fabric, and want to interact with the Mats fabric of Endpoints.
 * <p/>
 * Another aspect to understand, is that while Mats "guarantees" that a successfully submitted initiation will flow
 * through the Mats endpoints, no matter what happens with the processing nodes <i>(unless you employ <i>NonPersistent
 * messaging</i>, which futurizeNonessential(..) does!)</i>, nothing can be guaranteed wrt. the completion of the
 * future: This is stateful processing. The node where the MatsFuturizer initiation is performed can crash right after
 * the message has been put on the Mats fabric, and hence the CompletableFuture vanishes along with everything else on
 * that node. The mats flow is however already in motion, and will be executed - but when the Reply comes in on the
 * node-specific Topic, there is no longer any corresponding CompletableFuture to complete. This is also why you should
 * not compose Mats endpoints using this familiar feeling that a CompletableFuture probably gives you: While a
 * multi-stage MatsEndpoint is asynchronous, resilient and highly available and each stage is transactionally performed,
 * with retries and all the goodness that comes with a message oriented architecture, once you rely on a
 * CompletableFuture, you are in a synchronous world where a power outage or a reboot can stop the processing midway.
 * Thus, the MatsFuturizer should always just be employed out the very outer edge facing the actual client - any other
 * processing should be performed using MatsEndpoints, and composition of MatsEndpoints should be done using multi-stage
 * MatsEndpoints.
 * <p/>
 * Note that in the case of pure "GET-style" requests where information is only retrieved and no state in the total
 * system is changed, everything is a bit more relaxed: If a processing fails, the worst thing that happens is a
 * slightly annoyed user. But if this was an "add order" or "move money" instruction from the user, a mid-processing
 * failure is rather bad and could require human intervention to clean up. <b>Thus, the
 * <code>futurizeNonessential(..)</code> method should only be employed for such <i>safe</i> "GET-style" requests</b>.
 * Any other potentially state changing operations must employ the generic <code>futurize(..)</code> method.
 * <p/>
 * A question you might have, is how this works in a multi-node setup? For a Mats flow, it does not matter which node a
 * given stage of a MatsEndpoint is performed, as it is by design totally stateless wrt. the executing node, as all
 * state resides in the message. However, for a synchronous situation as in a HTTP request, it definitely matters that
 * the final reply, the one that should complete the returned future, comes in on the same node that issued the request,
 * as this is where the CompletableFuture instance is, and where the waiting TCP connection is connected! The trick here
 * is that the final reply is specified to come in on a <i>node-specific topic</i>, i.e. it literally has the node name
 * (default being the hostname) as a part of the MatsEndpoint name, and it is a
 * {@link MatsFactory#subscriptionTerminator(String, Class, Class, ProcessTerminatorLambda) SubscriptionTerminator}.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Logger MDCs for completion and metrics</b> <i>(on the logger <code>"io.mats3.util.MatsFuturizer.Reply"</code> if
 * INFO-enabled)</i>:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_FUTURE_COMPLETED "mats.FutureCompleted"}</b>: Present on a single logline per Future
 * completed, the value is the total time taken from futurization Request was initiated, until the future is

 * <li><b>{@link #MDC_MATS_INIT_ID "mats.init.Id"}</b>: The 'from' parameter in the futurization call, i.e. the

 * complete the future. If the calling thread that initiated the futurization directly blocks on the future.get(), this

     * message (and hence the Mats flow) is lost!</b>
     * <p/>
     * The goal of this method is to be able to get hold of e.g. account holdings, order statuses etc, for presentation
     * to a user. The thinking is that if such a flow fails where a message of the call flow disappears, this won't make
     * for anything else than a bit annoyed user: No important state change, like the adding, deleting or change of an
     * order, will be lost. Also, speed is of the essence. Therefore, <i>non-persistent</i>. At the same time, to make
     * the user super happy in the ordinary circumstances, all messages in this call flow will be prioritized, and thus
     * skip any queue backlogs that have arose on any of the call flow's endpoints, e.g. due to some massive batch of
     * (background) processes executing at the same time. Therefore, <i>interactive</i>. Notice that with both of these
     * features combined, you get very fast messaging, as non-persistent means that the message will not have to be
     * stored to permanent storage at any point, while interactive means that it will skip any backlogged queues. In
     * addition, the <i>noAudit</i> flag is set, since it is a waste of storage space to archive the actual contents of
     * Request and Reply messages that do not alter the system.
     * <p/>
     * Sets the following properties on the sent Mats message:
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>Non-persistent</b>: Since it is not vitally important that this message is not lost, non-persistent
     * messaging can be used. The minuscule chance for this message to disappear is not worth the considerable overhead
     * of store-and-forward multiple times to persistent storage. Also, speed is much more interesting.</li>
     * <li><b>Interactive</b>: Since the Futurizer should only be used as a "synchronous bridge" when a human is
     * actively waiting for the response, the interactive flag is set. <i>(For all other users, you should rather code
     * "proper Mats" with initiations, endpoints and terminators)</i>.</li>
     * <li><b>No audit</b>: Since this message will not change the state of the system (i.e. the "GET-style" requests),
     * using storage on auditing requests and replies is not worthwhile.</li>
     * </ul>
     * This method initiates an <b>{@link MatsInitiate#nonPersistent() non-persistent}</b> (unreliable),
     * <b>{@link MatsInitiate#interactive() interactive}</b> (prioritized), <b>{@link MatsInitiate#noAudit()
     * non-audited}</b> (request and reply DTOs won't be archived) Request-message to the specified endpoint, returning
     * a {@link CompletableFuture} that will be {@link CompletableFuture#complete(Object) completed} when the Reply from
     * the requested endpoint comes back. The internal MatsFuturizer timeout will be set to <b>2.5 minutes</b>, meaning
     * that if there is no reply forthcoming within that time, the {@link CompletableFuture} will be
     * {@link CompletableFuture#completeExceptionally(Throwable) completed exceptionally} with a
     * {@link MatsFuturizerTimeoutException MatsFuturizerTimeoutException}, and the Promise deleted from the futurizer.
     * 2.5 minutes is probably too long to wait for any normal interaction with a system, so if you use the
     * {@link CompletableFuture#get(long, TimeUnit) CompletableFuture.get(timeout, TimeUnit)} method of the returned
     * future, you might want to put a lower timeout there - if the answer hasn't come within that time, you'll get a
     * {@link TimeoutException}. If you instead use the non-param variant {@link CompletableFuture#get() get()}, you
     * will get an {@link ExecutionException} when the 2.5 minutes have passed (that exception's
     * {@link ExecutionException#getCause() cause} will be the {@link MatsFuturizerTimeoutException
     * MatsFuturizerTimeoutException} mentioned above).
