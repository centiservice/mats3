/**
 * A <i>State Transfer Object</i> meant for unit tests.

 * Note about STOs in general: The STOs in use by the different multi-stage endpoints are to be considered private
 * implementation details, and should typically reside as a private inner class of the endpoint employing them.
 * <p>
 * Typically, a STO class should just be fields that are access directly - they are to be employed like a "this"
 * object for the state that needs to traverse stages. The equals(..), hashCode() and toString() of this testing STO
 * is just to facilitate efficient testing.
 * <p>
 * The possibility to send STOs along with the request should only be employed if both the sender and the endpoint
 * to which the state is sent along to, resides in the same code base, and hence still can be considered private
 * implementation details.
