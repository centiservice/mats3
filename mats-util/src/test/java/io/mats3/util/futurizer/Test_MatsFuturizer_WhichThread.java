                     * Nap some millis, just to ensure that the main thread has already gotten to its wait point. The
                     * idea is that we're trying to make sure that .get() is actively holding the main thread so that we
                     * can check if the CompletableFuture was implemented in such a way that if any thread was actively
                     * waiting on the result of a chain of CompletableFutures, it would be executed on that waiting
                     * thread. It seems like this is not the case: The "stack" of CompletableFutures's "thenApply" and
                     * "thenAccept" is executed on the thread that invokes ".complete(..)", and when the final result is
                     * ready, only then is the result handed over to the thread "hanging" on .get(). Good stuff with the
                     * completer thread-pool then, so that we do not hold on to the Mats topic receiver thread (in the
                     * SubscriptionTerminator) longer than absolutely necessary.
                     *
                     * Notice, new info 2022-10-02: If the CompletableFuture has already completed when .thenApply() etc
                     * is invoked, /then/ it will be executed by the calling thread (i.e. 'main' or the test worker). If
                     * the .thenApply() is invoked /before/ the CompletableFuture, then it will be the completer (i.e.
                     * the "MatsFuturizer completer") that executes it. Basically, if you have an already completed
                     * future on your hands, invoking methods like .thenApply() will have to be invoked by you - there
                     * are no other threads available. But if a new CompleteableFuture is already made (i.e. what
                     * thenApply() does), the "stack" will be executed by the completer.
                     *
                     * Therefore, to ensure that it will be the "MatsFuturizer completer" which runs it (which these
                     * tests assume), we'll wait a good while here.
